- Perform Linear Regression and Predict the 'Price' from the test set,
- Show the coefficients of your linear regression model for each feature and show the y-intercept value of your linear regression model. (Interpret the coefficients),
- Find the MAE, MAPE, MSE, RMSE, coefficient of determination values from the actual target variable and the predicted target variable,
- Compare the actual and predicted target variable through visualization.
